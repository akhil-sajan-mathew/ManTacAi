She loved the vibrant atmosphere of the café, and her customers adored her friendly demeanor and the special care she put into every cup.    However, there was one dark cloud in her otherwise sunny coffee shop world-her supervisor, Mr. Thompson. Mr. Thompson was known for his stern and unpredictable behavior. He often played mind games with his employees, but no one was on the receiving end quite as often as Sarah.    One chilly winter morning, Sarah arrived at work, ready to brew up the perfect cappuccinos and warm the hearts of her customers. As she went about her tasks, she couldn't help but notice that the milk frother was malfunctioning. Bubbles were forming in the milk foam, and the coffee just didn't have the velvety texture she aimed for.    Sarah quickly approached Mr. Thompson, hoping to resolve the issue. She explained the problem with the milk frother and suggested that it might need maintenance.    Mr. Thompson's response, however, was baffling. He glanced at the frother, then back at Sarah, and said with an air of condescension, ""Sarah, you're imagining things. The frother is working perfectly fine. Maybe it's your technique that's the problem.""    Sarah was taken aback. She knew she was meticulous in her coffee preparation, and other customers had also noticed the issue. Nevertheless, she decided to trust her supervisor's judgment and continued her work. The bubbles persisted, and so did her frustration.    Throughout the day, Mr. Thompson made a point of nitpicking every little detail of Sarah's work. He accused her of being careless, making mistakes, and even hinted that she might not be suitable for her role.    As the day wore on, Sarah's confidence eroded. Doubts began to creep in. Maybe she was making mistakes. Maybe she wasn't as good as she thought she was. She found herself questioning her abilities and feeling a sense of inadequacy that had never haunted her before.    It wasn't until one of her loyal customers, who had been observing the odd exchange, approached her and said, ""Sarah, I've been coming here for years, and your coffee is always amazing. Don't let your supervisor's mind games get to you.""    Sarah realized that she had been a victim of gaslighting, and it was Mr. Thompson who had created the illusion of her incompetence. With renewed confidence, she confronted her supervisor about the milk frother issue once more. This time, she was assertive, and the problem was resolved promptly.    Sarah continued to work at the coffee shop, but she remained vigilant, determined not to let Mr. Thompson's gaslighting tactics undermine her self-worth and passion for making exceptional coffee. She knew that her skills and dedication were real, and no amount of manipulation could change that.","Yes","Male",22,"train"

However, the supervisor persisted, implying a connection between the worker's race and their shortcomings.
