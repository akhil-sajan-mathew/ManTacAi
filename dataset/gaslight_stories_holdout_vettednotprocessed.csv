2261,"It had been a difficult morning shift. The campus coffee shop was dangerously understaffed, which wasn't unusual for a Wednesday. Most of my coworkers had morning classes, and were unavailable as a result. Unfortunately, as finals week began looming over campus, we gained several new morning customers. This Wednesday, students flooded in through the door the second we had opened, and many of them had stress that overrode their compassion. The coffee shop was the busiest it had been all semester. Our supervisor helped us serve them, but couldn't do much to help contain their chaos. By the end of the shift, the clamoring of the customers had drained me of my energy and my patience.   But I still had classes to go to and finals to prepare for.   I went to the back and took off my coffee stained apron, hung it up and was ready to clock out when I caught a glimpse of the schedule for finals week.   At the beginning of the semester, I put in a request to my supervisor to have a Wednesday morning shift off for a final that one of my professors refused to let me reschedule. Even though the final was on a Wednesday morning, my supervisor approved because they were informed so far in advance.   When I saw my name listed under Wednesday morning's shift on the finals week schedule, I nearly burst into tears.   I immediately went out to find my supervisor and pulled her aside.  ""This better be an emergency. Do you see how busy it is out there?""  ""I'm fully aware of how busy it is out there. But I just saw my name under the opening shift Wednesday morning during finals week. I asked for that shift off four months ago.""  ""I don't remember that.""  ""I put in a request at the beginning of the semester and you approved it!""  ""I don't think you ever put in a request to have that shift off. I know you're stressed because of finals week and the busier shifts, but lying to me is unacceptable.""  ""I'm not lying! I do have a final Wednesday morning and you approved my request to have that shift off!""  ""Well, I don't have any record of it, so you better stop trying to guilt me into giving you a shift off because you didn't plan properly.""  ""But I did plan properly! Can you please change the schedule?""  ""I'm not changing the schedule! We need you here! This shop can't run without you!""  ""But I have a final, so what am I supposed to do? I can't change the date of it. I already checked with my professor at the beginning of the semester, right before I sent the request in!""  ""All I know is that you better be here that morning or find someone to cover your shift. Otherwise, don't expect your job to be waiting for you when you come back.""  I opened my mouth to speak, but shut it to stop myself from sobbing. My eyes had filled with tears to the point that my vision was blurry. I was going to be late to my next class.

As soon as Joe's supervisor, Ken, lays eyes on him, Joe knows that he's probably about to be blamed for whatever it is that has Ken so riled up-as usual. Right on cue, as soon as Joe steps foot into the stock room, Ken starts laying into him, saying how he had reminded Joe last week to submit the bulk order for the plant-based menu drinks, which should have included the oatmilk. Still slightly disoriented from having to wake up early right after closing late the night before, Joe tries to defend himself, saying that he doesn't remember Ken ever asking him that; Joe vaguely remembers overhearing Ken asking his coworker, Julie, to put in the plant-based order, but due to his extreme fatigue, he isn't really sure what he remembers happened in that instance. Ken fires back, insisting that he had told Joe specifically to put in the order, and points to the walk-in cold storage doors for emphasis, saying how the two of them had been standing right there when the supposed conversation occurred. Continuing his tirade, Ken reminds Joe how it had been his idea for the shop to expand their plant-based options in the first place, and that now Joe will have to be the one to explain to their customers why their drinks made with oatmilk won't be available until the next bulk shipment comes in. Joe had been the one to suggest that the shop carry more plant-based drinks, so even though he can't remember Ken asking him to put in the order, he figures that he probably should have known that Ken would expect him to do it anyway, and that it probably is his fault for forgetting about it. Once he seemed to be satisfied with Joe's state of submission, as he turned around to walk out the back door, Ken remarks offhandedly that he better get over this forgetfulness if he wants to keep his job.

When Sarah would try to bring these things up with him, Tom would dismiss her concerns and tell her she was overreacting.    As time went on, Tom's behavior became increasingly erratic. He would tell Sarah things that she knew weren't true and then deny ever saying them. He would accuse her of being forgetful or losing her mind when she tried to confront him about his lies.

Among them was Sarah, a diligent student worker, who greeted customers with a warm smile and efficiently prepared their orders.    However, Sarah's positive attitude was often overshadowed by her supervisor, Mr. Thompson, whose management style bordered on toxic. One particular incident stands out vividly in Sarah's memory.    It was a busy morning rush, and Sarah was multitasking between brewing coffee, taking orders, and restocking supplies. Amidst the chaos, Mr. Thompson approached her station, wearing his usual stern expression.    ""Sarah, why is the espresso machine not cleaned properly? I specifically instructed you to ensure everything is spotless,"" he barked, his tone accusatory.    Startled, Sarah glanced at the gleaming espresso machine, puzzled by his complaint. She had meticulously followed the cleaning protocol earlier that morning, but she dared not argue with her supervisor.    ""I'm sorry, Mr. Thompson. I'll recheck it right away,"" Sarah replied, her voice tinged with uncertainty.    As she began to inspect the machine, Mr. Thompson continued to hover nearby, his presence looming over her like a dark cloud. With every detail she examined, Sarah grew more bewildered. The machine was indeed clean, just as she had left it.    ""I don't see any issues, Mr. Thompson. It looks clean to me,"" Sarah said tentatively, hoping to alleviate the situation.

Despite the gaslighting tactics employed by her supervisor, Sarah remained resilient, determined not to let his toxic behavior undermine her confidence.
